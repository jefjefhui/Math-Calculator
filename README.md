Math Calculator
The Math Calculator application is developed in Python. The Math Calculator is like a normal calculator in real life, it can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root on a value. The math calculator can also perform operations on positive and negative values.
The flow of the math calculator is quite simple. The operations of the math calculator is like the physical calculator, but users need to use the cursor to select the numbers and the operators when they use the application.
